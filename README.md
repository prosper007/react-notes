# lab3-prosper007
## What I did
I made a React real-time notes app. It's connected to a Firebase database.
## What didn't work
I found it difficult to make the draggable notes controlled with the react-draggable component library. There was an bug where the box was offset when you start dragging but passing an event to my update function fixed this. This lab is actually pretty cool. This is basically Google Docs. Well maybe not but close enough
## Extra Credit Attempted
* Dragging updates z-index so any dragged note has the highest z-index and stays on top
* Added database rule so user cannot create note without a title and text. Having either one is fine.
* Snaps to grid
